Fiber Nova will be a full, feature filled Scratch "OS" that is completely cloud oriented. As a team we've been able to take advantage of something we call a "Cloud Server" to make the dream a reality. It is planned to have 4 apps - Mail and Contacts, Music, Composer, and Draw. Each of these applications will be able to work in two states - "offline" and "online." Offline, not being connected to the server, online, being connected.

## Concept
The first thing we did when we started Fiber Nova was look at previous versions.
