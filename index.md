Fiber Nova will be a full, feature filled Scratch "OS" that is completely cloud oriented. As a team we've been able to take advantage of something we call a "Cloud Server" to make the dream a reality. It is planned to have 4 apps - Mail and Contacts, Music, Composer, and Draw. Each of these applications will be able to work in two states - "offline" and "online." Offline, not being connected to the server, online, being connected.

## Concept
The first thing we did when we started Fiber Nova was look at previous versions.

Fiber consist of screens that do different task or apps. These apps are very light weight, but they make up for that with quantity.

The Homescreen is the control center of the whole project. You can talk to the  assistant, see time and date, manage music, and select apps to open. Design wise, the Homescreen focuses on clarity and elegance.
